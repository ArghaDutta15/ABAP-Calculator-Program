# ABAP Calculator Program

A simple yet functional calculator application developed in **ABAP**, capable of performing basic arithmetic operations such as **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** directly within the SAP environment.  

This project demonstrates how to build interactive programs in ABAP using **selection screens**, **pushbuttons**, and **event handling** with `sy-ucomm`.
